This page describes how to install the latest VDrift package. It assumes you have [downloaded the latest release](Downloading "wikilink").

Windows
-------

-   Double click the **vdrift-*yyyy-mm-dd*.exe** file (probably in your **Downloads** folder).
-   Follow the instructions in the wizard that opens.
-   Start VDrift from the Start menu (if you have chosen to install the shortcuts).

OS X
----

-   If your browser hasn't automatically opened it, double click the **vdrift-mac-*yyyy-mm-dd*.dmg** file (probably in your **Downloads** folder).
-   Drag or copy the **VDrift** application from the resulting mounted disk image named **VDrift** to your **Applications** folder.
-   Double-click the **VDrift** application now found in your **Applications** folder.

Linux
-----

VDrift hasn't been released with a standalone binary package for several releases. If you think you could help us with this, please post in the forums!

FreeBSD
-------

To install the binary package, just use **pkg\_add**:

`pkg_add -r vdrift`

`cd /usr/ports/games/vdrift-data && make install clean clean-depends`
