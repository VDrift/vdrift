-   [Cars](http://cars.vdrift.net/) - VDrift cars database.
-   [Forum](http://vdrift.net/Forum/) - Discuss new features and development, report bugs and get help with problems in the forums.
-   [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdrift) - VDrift downloads are hosted on SourceForge, as well as the data repository.
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/VDrift/vdrift) - This includes a public browser for the main VDrift Git tree, as well as HTTP access to the tree itself.
-   [Wiki](http://wiki.vdrift.net/) - The VDrift Wiki is the home of all the project's documentation.
-   [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/vdrift/issues/list) - Tracks the fixing of bugs and implementing of new features.
-   [Chat](http://vdrift.net/staticpages/index.php?page=irc-chat) - IRC channel used both for developer discussion and user support. If you have a problem or question feel free to stop by and ask.

Driving Simulation Information

Open Source Driving Simulators and Racing Games
-----------------------------------------------

Some more driving simulators:

-   [The Open Race Car Simulator (TORCS)](http://torcs.org/) - A car racing simulation focusing on AI racing and research. It can also be used as a ordinary car racing game too.
-   [Trigger Rally](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trigger-rally/) - A fast-paced open source rally racing game.
-   [Vamos Automotive Simulator](http://vamos.sourceforge.net/) - A automotive simulation framework with an emphasis on thorough physical modeling and good C++ design. It includes a real-time, first-person, 3D driving application.
-   [Speed Dreams](http://speed-dreams.sourceforge.net/) - A fork of the TORCS, aiming to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to make a more enjoyable game for the player, as well as constantly improving visual and physics realism.
-   [Super TuxCart](http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/) - A free 3D kart racing game
-   [Stunt Rally](http://code.google.com/p/vdrift-ogre/) - A racing game that focuses on closed rally tracks with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes). It uses VDrift for car simulation.
